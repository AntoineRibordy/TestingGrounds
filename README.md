# Testing Grounds

This game is being developed as part of the [Udemy Unreal Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4). 

It's an FPS inspired by the Hunger Games, where you move through different areas and can either fight enemies or escape stealthily.

As it's part of a course, credit for the code should be given partly to Ben Tristem. Feel free to re-use if some code is useful to you.
